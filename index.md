## ABOUT ME

My name is Huyen Vu. I am passionate about analyzing and working with data. I have experience in working with data as part of my previous internships and academic projects. I'm a highly motivated person who is detail-oriented, highly organized, and responsible and I am able to work well both as a team member and independently.

I am proficient in using Python, R, JavaScript, and SQL. I am interested in data mining, machine learning, and data visualization (some libraries I have experience with includes matplotlib, seaborn, d3, vegalite, ggplot2). Please check out my Observables Notebook page for some data visualization using d3.js that I am working on.
