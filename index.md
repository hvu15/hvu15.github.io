# Hello! Welcome to my Portfolio!

## ABOUT ME

My name is Huyen Vu. I am a Data Science Masters Graduate, with a Bachelor's Degree double majors in Business Economics and Finance. I am passionate about analyzing and working with data. I have experience in working with data as part of my previous internships and academic projects. I'm a highly motivated person who is detail-oriented, highly organized, and responsible, and I am able to work well both as a team member and independently.

To improve my skills and knowledge, I was a member of the research project team to develop deep learning solutions to various image detection problems. I am proficient in using Python, R, JavaScript, and SQL. I am interested in data mining, machine learning, and data visualization (some libraries I have experience with includes matplotlib, seaborn, d3, vegalite, ggplot2). Please check out my Observables Notebook page for some data visualization using d3.js that I am working on. More projects will be added to the project list below!

If you are interested in learning more about me, please send me an email or connect with me on LinkedIn!

## PROJECTS

### Machine Learning/Deep Learning

#### [Credit Card Approval using Decision Tree](https://github.com/hvu15/credit-card-approval-decision-tree) [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-black?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/hvu15/credit-card-approval-decision-tree)

Applied decision tree algorithm on the Credit Card Approval Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository. Used different values for the hyper-parameter max_depth and different criterion specification. Examined overall accuracy score with different max_depth values and different criterion specification.

#### [Exploring Ensemble Learning](https://github.com/hvu15/explore-ensemble-learning) [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-black?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/hvu15/explore-ensemble-learning)

Explored ensemble learning using the Adult Dataset from the UCI machine learning repository. Methods used: Ensemble Classifier, Bagging Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier.

#### [Keras for Fraud Detection](https://github.com/hvu15/Keras-for-fraud-detection) [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-black?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/hvu15/Keras-for-fraud-detection)

Applied deep learning Keras to Bitcoin graph data set on Kaggle - Elliptic Data Set - to classify licit and illicit Bitcoin transaction. Created a visualization of the model accuracy and model loss.

#### [Fake News Detection](https://github.com/hvu15/fake-news-detection) [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-black?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/hvu15/fake-news-detection)

Built a model to accurately classify a piece of news as real or fake using the news data set on DataFlair. Applied TfidfVectorizer and PassiveAggressiveClassifier.

#### [Detecting Credit Card Fraud](https://github.com/hvu15/detecting-credit-card-fraud) [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-black?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/hvu15/detecting-credit-card-fraud)

Applied different machine learning techniques to identify credit card fraud transaction, using Kaggle's Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset. Exploratory Data Analysis was performed to get some insights about the data set. Methods used: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest Classifier, K-Means Clustering, K-Nearest Neighbors, Deep learning Keras.

### Web Scraping

#### [Super Bowl Champions](https://observablehq.com/@thanhuyen1809/super-bowl-champions) [![Observables](https://img.shields.io/badge/Observables-black)](https://observablehq.com/@thanhuyen1809/super-bowl-champions)

Scraped data from the Wikipedia List of Super Bowl Champions page and created visualization using vegalite.
